### Arrow Function

- It has a shorter syntax than standard function.
- It does not bind their own `this`.
- Arrow functions are best suited for non-method function.

**Example Syntax**

```
(param1, param2) => { statements }
```

If function have only one param, you can emit the `()` around the paramters and if it has only one statment in the method, you can emit `{}` in method body. And when you don't put `{}` brances, it will return that expression result.

```
param => statment
(param) => {return statmenet }

// Above 2 functions are equal.
```

If there is no parameter required for a function, `()` is required.

```
() => statmenet
() => { expressions }
() => { return expression }
```

**Example Methods**

```
const multiply = (x*y) => { return x*y }
const multiply = (x*y) =>  return x*y 
```
